    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        My motivation to become a developer stems from a deep-seated passion for problem-solving and a love for building things. I am fascinated by the way code can transform abstract ideas into tangible, functional applications. The process of debugging, iterating, and finally seeing a project come to life is incredibly rewarding. I believe that through software, I can contribute to creating tools that make life easier, connect people, and solve real-world challenges. The continuous learning required to stay current in this field is an added bonus, as I am always excited to tackle new technologies and expand my skill set.
